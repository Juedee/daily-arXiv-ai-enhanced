Motivated by recent photocurrent measurements of vibronic sidebands in WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ optoelectronic devices, we present a nonperturbative theoretical framework for phonon-assisted absorption in van der Waals heterostructures. Using a polaron transformation, a closed-form expression for the optical absorption spectrum at arbitrary temperatures is presented. Our model includes both intraband and interband electron--phonon coupling. Detailed analysis shows that the observed periodic sidebands originate from the strong coupling between interlayer excitons and nearly dispersionless optical phonon modes. Comparing two limiting cases - one involving only intraband couplings, and another incorporating coherent interband processes - we show that interband phonon-assisted transitions are needed to account for the observed data. Beyond enabling the direct estimation of vibronic coupling strengths from spectroscopic data, these findings have profound consequences for our understanding of optical and optoelectronic responses: coherent interband coupling of atomic vibrations to excitons is essential to quantifying photoresponse in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures."}

Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $μ^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders.

However, their controlled engineering, including tuning lateral domain size and integration into vertical van der Waals heterostructures with other 2D materials, remains challenging. Here, we present a facile route for the synthesis of two types of heterostructures consisting of monolayers of MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ - purely lateral (HS I) and hybrid lateral/vertical (HS II) - using liquid precursors of transition metal salts and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Depending on the growth parameters, the heterostructure type and their lateral dimensions can be adjusted. We characterized properties of the HS I and HS II by complementary spectroscopic and microscopic techniques including Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, and optical and atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. The photoluminescence measurements reveal strong interlayer exciton emission in the MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ region of HS II, which dominates the spectrum at 4 K and persisting up to room temperature. These results demonstrate high optical quality of the grown heterostructures which in combination with scalability of the developed approach paves the way for fundamental studies and device applications based on these unique 2D quantum materials."}

These conclusions are corroborated by calculations of $J(x)$ in a thin strip coupled inductively with side control wires or in bilayer strip structures by solving the London and Ginzburg Landau equations in the thin film Pearl limit. Thermally-activated penetration of vortices from the edges and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs in inverted $J(x)$ profiles are evaluated.

Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) analysis suggests that LiMgZr2H12 reaches a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 60.8 K at ambient pressure.

Thus, the prevailing interpretation of ferroelectric switching dynamics fails under real operating conditions. Here we introduce a compact dynamic-field-driven nucleation and growth (DFNG) model that enables quantitative fits to switching transients across multiple ferroelectric materials to extract time-varying domain wall velocity and growth dimensionality, even under arbitrary voltage waveform. This capability then motivates its use in device modeling under complex signals spanning disparate time and frequency scales.

Prevailing theoretical frameworks have predominantly emphasized electronic degrees of freedom, largely neglecting the rich physics inherent in the lattice. Although conventional phonon theory offers an elegant description of structural phase diagrams and lattice dynamics, its omission of nuclear quantum many-body effects results in misleading phase diagram interpretations and, consequently, an unsound foundation for superconducting theory. Here, by incorporating nuclear quantum many-body effects within first-principles calculations, we discover a lattice quantum disordered phase in superconductors H3S and La3Ni2O7. This phase occupies a triangular region in the pressure-temperature phase diagram, whose left boundary aligns precisely with Tc of the left flank of the superconducting dome. The Tcmax of this quantum disordered phase coincides with the maximum of superconducting Tc, indicating this phase as both the origin of superconductivity on the dome's left flank and a key ingredient of its pairing mechanism. Our findings advance the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity and establish the lattice quantum disordered phase as a unifying framework, both for predicting new superconductors and for elucidating phenomena in a broader context of condensed matter physics."}

Furthermore, its applicability is limited to systems with spin-orbit coupling, which motivates the need for alternative measures of chirality. In this work, we explore two complementary measures of chirality: electron chirality and hydrodynamic helicity. By analyzing a minimal atomic model under chiral crystal fields, we clarify how the interplay among crystal fields, spin-orbit coupling, and electron correlation gives rise to non-zero values of chirality measures. Although electron chirality increases with both spin-orbit coupling and chiral crystal field strength, the dependence on these two factors is highly non-trivial. Particularly, when the chiral crystal field is varied continuously and the energy levels approach quasidegenerate points, the electron chirality is insensitive to spin-orbit coupling, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of chirality. In contrast, the hydrodynamic helicity, defined as a two-body pseudoscalar quantity, remains non-zero even without spin-orbit coupling, originating from electron-electron interactions. Perturbative analysis reveals distinct symmetry selection rules governing the two quantities. Our results provide fundamental insight into the origin of chiralities in electronic systems."}

In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies."}

This effect arises from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the exciton condensate, resulting in direction-dependent critical counterflow currents. The resulting nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag provides a clear and unambiguous transport signature of phase-coherent exciton condensation, offering a powerful and experimentally accessible approach to identify, probe, and control exciton superfluidity in solid-state platforms."}

Through extensive exploration of the Sr-Li-Al-O and Ba-Y-Al-O systems, we show that uMLIP can rediscover experimentally known materials absent from its training set and identify seven new thermodynamically and dynamically stable compounds. These include a new polymorph of Sr2LiAlO4 (P3221) and a new disordered phase, Sr2Li4Al2O7 (P1_bar). Furthermore, our results show stability predictions based on the semilocal PBE functional require cross-validation with higher-level methods, such as SCAN and RPA, to ensure reliability. While uMLIPs substantially reduce the computational cost of CSP, the primary bottleneck has shifted to the efficiency of search algorithms in navigating complex structural spaces. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of uMLIP-driven CSP in the discovery of new materials."}

Then, using atomistic tight-binding and strain-extended continuum models to study the commensurate structures, we identify configurations that minimize the bandwidth beyond the magic angle. The results reveal a strong dependence of band narrowing and topology on strain type, magnitude, direction and lattice relaxation. Particularly, shear strain produces a stronger distortion than uniaxial strain. Including electron-electron interactions through a self-consistent Hartree potential shows that strain broadens the bare bands while reducing electrostatic renormalization. Strain also drives topological transitions as the narrow and remote bands hybridize, establishing twisted and strained bilayer graphene as a tunable platform for flat-band and topological phenomena."}

Elements from the first three rows of the periodic table, together with selected transition and coinage metals, were examined on the pristine surface and at boron- and nitrogen-vacancy sites. On pristine h-BN, adsorption is generally weak and dominated by dispersion forces, with measurable chemisorption limited to highly electronegative atoms such as C, O, and F. The introduction of vacancies transforms h-BN into a chemically active material, increasing adsorption energies by one to two orders of magnitude. The boron vacancy strongly stabilizes metallic and electropositive species through coordination to undercoordinated nitrogen atoms, whereas the nitrogen vacancy selectively binds electronegative and covalent adsorbates. Scaling of adsorption energies with elemental cohesive energies distinguishes regimes of physisorption, chemisorption, and substitutional stabilization. These insights provide a unified description of adsorption trends across the periodic table and establish defect engineering as an effective strategy for tailoring the catalytic, sensing, and electronic properties of h-BN."}

The physics enabling the polarimetry lies in polarization-dependent shift of the electron hot spot near the contact, and the gate tuning of the of light-sensitive barrier width.

Within this framework, we identify Majorana's Butterfly as a fractal topological phase diagram governed by the competition between quasicrystallinity and superconducting pairing. We show that this competition dictates a hierarchy of Majorana stability, where the survival of the topological phase against fractal fragmentation is determined by the relative strength of these competing energy scales."}

Skyrmions have so far been explored in different magnetic materials, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. Here, we propose a new type of unconventional skyrmions stabilized in noncollinear magnets. Using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate that a noncollinear ground state can be stabilized in Rh/Co and Pd/Co atomic bilayers on the Re(0001) surface by four spin exchange interactions, although Co -- a material often used in applications -- is a prototypical ferromagnet with strong pairwise exchange interaction. We further show that unconventional skyrmion lattices and isolated skyrmions can emerge on this noncollinear magnetic background. Transition-state theory calculations reveal that these metastable skyrmions are protected by large energy barriers, suggesting that they could be observed in experiments. These unconventional types of skyrmions in noncollinear magnets might open new possibilities for topological spin transport or magnet-superconductor hybrid systems."}

Individual junctions exhibit thermally activated spin-transfer torque switching with transition probabilities that are well described by a Poisson process. When two junctions are connected in parallel, circuit-mediated redistribution of voltages that occurs in real time as the junction resistances change leads to correlated switching behavior. A minimal stochastic model based on single-junction statistical switching properties and Kirchhoff's laws captures the coupled switching probabilities, while a Markov-chain formalism describes nonequilibrium steady states under multi-pulse driving. Further, these circuit-mediated interactions can be mapped onto the parameters of an Ising Hamiltonian, providing an interpretation in terms of effective spin-spin interactions. Our results demonstrate how simple electrical connections can generate Ising-like couplings and tunable stochastic dynamics in nanoscale magnets."}

Its rich structural diversity, arising from multiple polymorphs accessible under different synthesis conditions, has made Ta2O5 a long-standing subject of interest. However, a unified understanding of the thermodynamic stability and phase transitions of its polymorphs across pressure-temperature (P-T) space has remained elusive. Here, using first-principles calculations, we map the thermodynamic landscape of Ta2O5 and establish a comprehensive P-T phase diagram together with a phase-stability hierarchy. We find that Gamma-Ta2O5 and B-Ta2O5 dominate the phase diagram over a broad range of P-T conditions: Gamma-Ta2O5 is stabilized at low pressures, while B-Ta2O5 becomes thermodynamically favored at higher pressures up to ~ 60 GPa, beyond which Y-Ta2O5 emerges as the most stable phase. Crucially, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) are shown to play a significant role in determining relative phase stability, contributing substantially to the Gibbs free energy and altering phase boundaries. A re-entrant phase transition between Gamma and B-Ta2O5 is predicted near ~ 2 GPa, revealing unexpected complexity in the phase behavior of this oxide. More generally, we identify a characteristic temperature (T_0), at which zero-point and thermal phonon contributions to the free energy become comparable, and show that T_0 is approximately one-third of the Debye temperature. This relationship provides a simple, physically transparent criterion for assessing the importance of NQEs in phase stability, with implications extending beyond Ta2O5 to a broad class of complex oxides."}

Although recent neural-network-based methods improve robustness against experimental noise, they are sensitive to training conditions, restricted to fixed-length inputs, and limited to trace-level outputs without explicit temporal localization of transition events. In this work, we apply a U-Net architecture to spin readout signal analysis by formulating transition-event detection as a point-wise segmentation task in one-dimensional time-series data. The fully convolutional structure enables direct processing of variable-length traces. Point-wise and sample-wise evaluations demonstrate low readout error rates and high classification accuracy without retraining. The proposed method generalizes well to previously-unseen trace lengths and experimental non-Gaussian noise, outperforming a conventional threshold-based approach and providing a robust and practical solution for automated spin readout signal analysis."}

This way, we fabricate a platform that hosts distinct heterotrilayer, heterobilayer, and homobilayer regions with enhanced excitonic features at elevated temperatures. Although the heterobilayer supports temperature-tunable singlet and triplet interlayer excitons, it exhibits low emission yield at 4 K. In comparison, the heterotrilayer shows remarkable excitonic properties, including pronounced band modulation, intervalley interlayer exciton transitions, and a tenfold photoluminescence enhancement along with a sevenfold increase in exciton decay time at cryogenic temperatures compared to the heterobilayer system. Temperature-dependent studies reveal intriguing interlayer exciton dynamics in the heterotrilayer, including the emergence of valley-polarized interlayer excitons, and the ability to maintain optical stability up to room temperature.

Building on the resonant exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) mechanism in 2H-phase TMDs, we report the first observation of upconversion photoluminescence (UPL) in rhombohedral MoS2 and demonstrate that this many-body process is strongly polytype-dependent. Using low-temperature spectroscopy, we observe anti-Stokes emission with superlinear power dependence. Beyond serving as a layer-number sensor, UPL provides a sensitive probe of stacking order. Trilayer ABA and BAB polytypes, indistinguishable by surface potential measurements and second harmonic generation, exhibit markedly different UPL intensities, and this persists in thicker samples. First-principles calculations attribute this polytype dependence to modulation of the Gamma-point conduction manifold, which controls energy-matching conditions for the annihilation process. Power-dependent spectroscopy further disentangles two distinct annihilation channels originating from different dark exciton valleys, identified through their contrasting intensity scaling and opposite density-induced energy shifts. Crucially, the annihilation process doubles the energy separation of nearly degenerate dark excitons while converting their weak emission into bright signal, providing experimental access to valley-specific responses that are obscured in direct dark-exciton spectroscopy. Our findings demonstrate that ferroelectric configurations provide a new degree of freedom for controlling nonlinear optical processes, with implications for all-optical ferroelectric readout and electrically switchable wavelength conversion in two-dimensional materials."}

X-ray diffraction technique, atomic force microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry are employed to study the structural, morphological, and magnetic properties. We adopt a qualitative approach to understand the nature of different anisotropies present in both materials. Mixed anisotropies evolve with film thicknesses for both fcc-Py and a-Co films. The role of growth conditions in the emergence of specific anisotropies is discussed in detail. An alteration of the magnetization easy axis from the conventional in-plane orientation is evidenced due to the collective influence of these mixed anisotropies. Based on the dominance of anisotropy components, their origin, and the direction of magnetization tilt, we categorize our samples as belonging to specific regimes.

In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies."}

While the magnetic moment of a ferromagnet aligns with an applied magnetic field, it has been experimentally shown that the magnetic order can be inverted by injecting spin current into the magnet. This results in an energetically unstable but dynamically stabilized state where the magnetic moment aligns antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, called the inverted magnetic state. The excitations on top of such a state have negative energy and are called antimagnons. The inverted state is subject to fluctuations, in particular, as shot noise in the spin current, which are different from fluctuations in equilibrium, especially at low temperatures. Here, we theoretically study the fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and their signatures in experimental setups. We find that the fluctuations from the injection of spin current play a large role. In the quantum regime, the inverted magnetic state exhibits larger fluctuations compared to the equilibrium position, which can be probed using a qubit. Our results advance the understanding of the fundamental properties of antimagnons and their experimental controllability, and they pave the way for applications in spintronics and magnonics, such as spin wave amplification and entanglement."}
