Errors can and often do occur due to the following issues: i) several measurement instruments still use Gaussian & cgs-emu units instead of the preferable International System (SI) units; ii) there are decades of valuable publications where, however, equations were expressed in Gaussian & cgs-emu or other unit systems or where constants were normalized to unity, which requires proper understanding and unit conversion in order to correctly evaluate the measured physical quantities; iii) the conversion between unit systems sometimes appears challenging and may not be properly performed. In this paper we will describe how to properly convert physical quantities relevant for the evaluation of magnetic and other properties focusing on the still most used unit systems, SI and Gaussian & cgs-emu. We will provide examples of how to properly verify and understand the physical formulae. We will include examples for the correct method to determine the critical current density Jc of a superconductor from the measurement of its magnetic hysteresis loop through the Bean model, and the correct conversion to SI of the equations for Hc2(T) according to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formulation. The goals of this paper are to make the readers aware of the unit conversion issue, to provide useful hands-on tools for proper conversion and to strongly encourage future exclusive use of the SI units and formulae."}

However, existing van der Waals-based vertical Josephson junctions largely rely on transfer-based assembly schemes that are incompatible with elemental materials such as niobium (Nb). Here, we introduce a freestanding van der Waals membrane architecture that enables deposition-based fabrication of vertical Josephson junctions through double-sided processing of a single suspended two-dimensional layer. Using multilayer graphene suspended across lithographically defined through-holes in a SiNx membrane, we realize vertical Nb/multilayer graphene/Nb Josephson junctions without ambient exposure of buried interfaces. The resulting devices exhibit clear Josephson coupling, including reproducible supercurrents and a temperature dependence of the critical current consistent with short-junction behaviour. Well-defined magnetic interference patterns governed by the membrane-defined aperture geometry, together with sub-gap features that track a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like superconducting gap, further confirm the junction quality. This platform establishes a scalable route to vertical superconducting devices based on oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors and van der Waals materials."}

Superconducting proximity converts the antiferromagnetic edges into one-dimensional topological superconductors, and the intersections between superconducting and magnetic edges bind Majorana zero modes as mass domain walls. Combining first-principles calculations with a calibrated effective boundary theory, we demonstrate robust corner localization and purely electrical control of Majorana fusion and braiding in a triangular geometry.

Here we show that a response-based diagnostic of effective non-Hermiticity can be formulated using minimal pseudo-Lorentz-symmetry-breaking deformations, which separate observables that remain captured by parameter redefinitions from those that exhibit irreducible NH structure. For a two-dimensional NH Dirac semimetal in the weak-NH, real-spectrum regime, we analyze Dirac-cone tilt and velocity anisotropy and compute representative probes of spectral structure, quantum geometry, optical response, and viscoelasticity at zero temperature. We find that tilt yields an NH-dependent slope of the density of states that cannot be collapsed to a single effective velocity, while velocity anisotropy can be captured by effective-velocity reparametrization. Furthermore, the quantum metric and collisionless optical conductivities provide NH-insensitive benchmarks (with the nonlinear conductivity symmetry selected), whereas the shear viscosity offers a discriminator through its tensor structure. Our results identify minimal deformations and bulk response channels that enable access to effective non-Hermiticity even when the spectrum remains real."}

Despite the impressive general reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), they struggle with two limitations for application in PSCs: an inability to align general semantics with the perovskite domain knowledge, and an inefficiency in navigating high-dimensional perovskite material and recipe design spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce a domain-knowledge-guided framework PVK-LLM, a specialized model to serve as an expert to bridge general semantics with perovskite domain knowledge. By integrating this domain knowledge into a hierarchical Bayesian Optimization workflow, our approach efficiently navigates the high-dimension design space on a solar cell simulator platform. The domain knowledge resolves cold-start problems while dynamically adapting to simulator feedback. Moreover, in an individual wet-lab experiment aimed at maximizing power conversion efficiency (PCE), our framework autonomously proposes a novel synergistic four-component recipe comprising specialized organic passivation recipe (3MTPAI, PDAI2, EDAI2, and PipDI) which has not been reported in existing literature. This AI-designed recipe effectively achieves a champion PCE value of over 26.0 %, approaching world records achieved through extensive expert trial-and-error.

Starting from a general Bogoliubov--de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian with a separable pairing interaction, we derive a gauge-invariant expression for the Raman susceptibility, including a long-range Coulomb interaction. The resulting Raman susceptibility is directly computable for an arbitrary BdG Hamiltonian, which contains single- and multiband systems, spin-singlet and triplet order parameters, and time-reversal-symmetric and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting states. Based on the microscopic coupling between a Raman source field and collective modes, we derive a symmetry selection rule for Raman-active collective modes and show a group-theoretical classification for all crystalline point groups. This classification provides a unified framework based on the ``higher-order Lifshitz-invariant'' to identify Raman-active collective modes such as Leggett mode, Bardasis-Schrieffer (BS) mode, and clapping mode. As an application, we focus on an effective model of the heavy-fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ with a fully gapped multicomponent odd-parity pairing state.

This manuscript introduces a nanoscale effect in current carrying conductors, whereby surface charge induced radial electric fields are found to be inversely proportional to the radius of the conductive path. This nanoscale effect is then applied to explain the negative resistance switching (reset) mechanism in filamentary metal oxide resistive switching memory devices (memristors). Previous explanations for the negative resistive switching mechanism state that diffusion constitutes the radial driving mechanism for oxygen ions, and drift under electric fields is restricted to the direction parallel to current flow. This explanation conflicts with retention and microscopy data collected in a subset of devices presented in literature. We demonstrate that the electric field's dependency on the on the radius of a nanoscale conductive path can result in radial fields on the order of 10^5 to 10^6 V/cm at only -1 V bias, sufficient to govern the negative resistance switching mechanism in filamentary metal oxides. By accounting for this nanoscale size effect, long standing anomalous experimental data about the negative (reset) resistance switching mechanism in bipolar filamentary resistive memory devices is finally reconciled. Wide understanding of surface charges and associated electric fields in nanoscale conductive paths could prove important for further scaling of integrated circuits and aid in elucidating many nanoscale phenomena."}

Here, we develop a Deep Potential-based machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) framework, trained on extensive ab initio datasets and validated against experimental transport properties, to resolve early-stage SEI nucleation at lithium metal interfaces with quantum accuracy. We find that at the Li-metal interface, 3.5 M LiTFSI/DMC induces spontaneous, thermally activated reduction reactions, yielding rapidly growing thick anion-derived SEIs enriched in O/F-containing species. In contrast, 1.5-2.5 M LiTFSI/DMC and 1 M LiPF6/EMC/DMC/EC form thinner, LiF-dominated interphases with slower growth kinetics. Our modeling results are consistent with experimental observations, where 3.5 M LiTFSI enhances cycling stability and rate capability, while lower concentrations result in weaker passivation.

Two distinct regions are identified on the cleaved surface: the single Fermi surface region where only one Fermi surface is observed, and the double Fermi surface region where two Fermi surface sheets are resolved coming from both the inner (IP) and outer (OP) CuO$_2$ planes. The electronic structure and superconducting gap are measured on both of these two regions. In both cases, the observed electronic states are mainly concentrated near the nodal region.

These edge modes govern the transport behavior and give rise to sharp variations in transmission across the corresponding gap-closing transitions. A pronounced even-odd effect further emerges, where chains with an odd number of sites exhibit nearly perfect zero-energy transmission at the Dirac points, independent of system-lead coupling, system size, or modulation strength; a robust signature of ballistic transport. To capture the influence of environmental decoherence, we also incorporate Büttiker dephasing probes, which enable a phenomenological description of inelastic scattering and reveal how dephasing modifies, and in some regimes enhances, coherent transport."}

Oxygen is among the most common impurities in hBN, and numerous studies have reported a pronounced photoluminescence band centered near 3.5 eV following oxygen incorporation, yet its microscopic origin has remained unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that this emission originates from hole capture by neutral oxygen substituting for nitrogen (ON). The transition mechanism is non-trivial, involving not only a change in charge state but also a substantial structural reconfiguration: the positive and neutral states exhibit markedly different geometries and symmetries. In the neutral state the defect adopts a low-symmetry configuration with out-of-plane displacements of the oxygen and neighboring atoms. The calculated emission energy (3.63 eV) and lineshape are in excellent agreement with experiment."}

Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB.

When applied to LaAlO3 molecular-beam epitaxy, the weighting function defines a flat stoichiometric window and penalizes off-window proposals, thereby steering the optimization toward physically plausible regions while maintaining controlled exploration. In a closed-loop optimization, relative to the bare EI, which often proposes off-stoichiometric conditions, the weighted EI constrains the search toward stoichiometric regions while retaining sufficient flexibility to explore neighboring conditions, eventually identifying an optimum slightly beyond the stoichiometric window. Within only 15 growth runs, the lattice constant of the grown LaAlO3 film converged to the bulk value, evidencing efficient and rapid optimization for the ideal stoichiometric growth.

Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system."}

Structural analysis reveals favorable ductility and a relatively low Debye temperature. Analysis of interatomic interactions indicates that Ag-S and Ag-Cl bonds are relatively weak, resulting in local structural softness and enhanced lattice anharmonicity. These weak bonds facilitate phonon scattering and give rise to low-frequency localized rattling vibrations primarily associated with Ag atoms, contributing to reduced lattice thermal conductivity. In contrast, Bi-S bonds exhibit stronger, directional interactions, which help stabilize the overall structure. The coexistence of weak bonding and strong lattice coupling enables favorable modulation of thermal transport properties.Optically, AgBiSCl2 possesses a high static dielectric constant and exhibits strong absorption in the ultraviolet region. In terms of thermal transport, phonon spectrum exhibit mode hardening with temperature increasing. The localized Ag vibrations intensify the anharmonicity, reducing phonon lifetimes and group velocities.For electronic transport, the p-type material maintains a higher Seebeck coefficient than the n-type, while the latter shows greater electrical conductivity. At 700 K, the figure of merit reaches 0.77 for p-type and 0.69 for n-type AgBiSCl2, indicating promising high-temperature thermoelectric performance.In summary, AgBiSCl2 exhibits excellent potential for dual photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications.

However, it displays peaks and dips at the boundaries of the gap, suggesting that thermoelectric Hall conductivity can be used to probe the bandwidth. Similarly, the low-temperature thermal Hall coefficient, which also shows a linear temperature dependence for the thermal Hall conductivity, becomes quantized in the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. This quantization indicates that thermal Hall conductivity can serve as a probe for the topological properties of the system."}

In this work, we investigate the role of reactor height on the crystallinity evolution of MOCVD-grown $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films by directly comparing long- and short-chamber showerhead configurations. Structural evolution was probed by in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) as the MOCVD-grown films were heated from 25~$^\\circ$C to 1100~$^\\circ$C. Temperature-dependent XRD reveals a consistent redshift of the $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$~($-201$) reflection after HT-XRD heating and subsequent cooling to room temperature for both reactor geometries, indicating a similar thermally driven strain response. Quantitative rocking-curve analysis shows a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the ($-201$) full width at half maximum (FWHM), with minimum values of approximately 2.03$^\\circ$ and 2.72$^\\circ$ for the short- and long-chamber films, respectively, reflecting differences in mosaic alignment established during growth. Atomic force microscopy further shows that short-chamber-grown films exhibit smoother surfaces, with root-mean-square roughness values of approximately 7.7~nm before and 7.3~nm after HT-XRD heating, compared to 19.3~nm and 12.3~nm, respectively, for long-chamber-grown films.

In this paper, we have investigated the magneto-optical properties, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and PMA of Pt/CoFeB/Ru multilayers engineered to possess significant iDMI. We utilized the Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (p-MOKE), Hall response and the domain wall motion in Pt/CoFeB/Ru-systems. Both MOKE and AHE measurements confirm that the films maintain strong perpendicular magnetization for CoFeB thicknesses below 1.2 nm. The effective magnetic anisotropy K_{\\mathrm{eff}} of 0.88 \\times 10^6 erg/cm^3 has been achieved without any post-annealing, highlighting the high-quality interface in this multilayer design. The angular dependence of the switching field deviates from the conventional Kondorsky model and is well described using a modified Kondorsky formalism, capturing the role of field-induced domain-wall softening and pinning effects in the reversal process. Furthermore, p-MOKE microscopy imaging during the magnetization reversal process provides detailed insight into domain nucleation and subsequent domain-wall propagation. The observations reveal well-defined, stable magnetic domains that evolve coherently under the applied magnetic field. Such a behavior is expected in the system where interfacial DMI, PMA interact to stabilize the chiral Néel-type domain walls, which are essential for fast, low-power domain-wall motion driven by spin-orbit torques."}

Often, vdWE is presumed on substrates with layers held together by vdW bonding, e.g., mica, without sufficient theoretical basis or experimental evidence. Here, in case of NaCl metal nitrides, we demonstrate the thin film growth of single-domain ScN(111) by conventional epitaxy on fluorophlogopite mica(001) by sputter deposition. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy reveal that the film/substrate epitaxial relationship is specified by [-101](111)ScN||[010](001)mica. The strong dependence of the (111) interplanar spacings with film thickness crystals indicates compressive stress buildup, which rules out the possibility of vdWE.

The results reveal a crossover from conventional cubic anisotropy-dominated behavior at higher temperatures to pronounced linewidth broadening and higher-order anisotropy contributions at cryogenic temperatures. With the magnetic field oriented along the [100] crystallographic direction, the resonance is well-captured by four-fold in-plane and out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropies. In contrast, measurements with the field along the [110] direction reveal the presence of an unusually large sixth-order cubic anisotropy term that is symmetry-suppressed for [100] but becomes apparent under this field orientation at ultralow temperatures, indicating a substantial modification of the anisotropy landscape. Independent linewidth analysis shows a pronounced peak near 8 K and a subtle monotonic enhancement with decreasing temperatures below 2 K, features consistent with dissipation mediated by a bath of two-level systems (TLS) arising from antisite defects and localized Fe$^{3+}$ moments. Comparison with TLS-based models demonstrates that both exchange-coupled impurities and nearly free paramagnetic centers contribute to the observed damping. Our results establish LAFO as a model ferrite system where disorder-induced TLS limit spin coherence at ultralow temperatures, providing new insights into anisotropy engineering, magnetic relaxation, and the design of ferrimagnetic insulators for coherent magnonics.

In this paper we will describe how to properly convert physical quantities relevant for the evaluation of magnetic and other properties focusing on the still most used unit systems, SI and Gaussian & cgs-emu. We will provide examples of how to properly verify and understand the physical formulae.

Two distinct regions are identified on the cleaved surface: the single Fermi surface region where only one Fermi surface is observed, and the double Fermi surface region where two Fermi surface sheets are resolved coming from both the inner (IP) and outer (OP) CuO$_2$ planes. The electronic structure and superconducting gap are measured on both of these two regions. In both cases, the observed electronic states are mainly concentrated near the nodal region. The momentum dependence of superconducting gap deviates from the standard d-wave form. These results indicate that the surface electronic structure of Hg1223 behaves more like that of underdoped cuprates."}
