However, the underlying pairing mechanism and its relationship to the material's electronic and magnetic ground states remain elusive. Since unconventional superconductivity often emerges from a complex interplay of magnetic correlations, elucidating the magnetic ground state of the nickelates at ambient pressure is crucial for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure. Here, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with tight-binding model simulation to investigate the electronic structure of the representative trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We provide the first experimental evidence of band splitting induced by interlayer coupling and further resolve the momentum-dependent density wave gap structures along all the Fermi surfaces. Our findings identify the mirror-selective Fermi surface nesting as the origin of the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin density wave and demonstrate the dominant role of Ni-3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in the low-energy physics of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. These results provide a fundamental framework for understanding the magnetic interactions and high-temperature superconductivity mechanism in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family."}

Recently, multiple experiments have observed half-quantum flux shifts in measurements of LP oscillations, where the oscillations are globally shifted by half a flux quantum compared to conventional cases, a behavior referred to as a $π$-ring. Such observations are commonly linked to unconventional pairing symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $π$-rings."}

In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering."}

Graphene serves as a prominent van der Waals template for molecular self-assembly; however, graphene on SiC is intrinsically heterogeneous, with decoupled monolayer graphene coexisting with residuals of a covalently bound buffer layer, which may affect molecular ordering. Here, we track the ordering of the molecular donor, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexamethoxytriphenylene (HMTP), from the first layer to thin films, combining low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction with X-ray diffraction. HMTP forms highly ordered epitaxial layers on single-layer graphene, whereas growth on the buffer layer initiates as amorphous and evolves into polycrystalline films with weak orientation with respect to the substrate. Crucially, hydrogen intercalation decouples the buffer layer, converting it into quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene and restoring epitaxial growth. These findings demonstrate that interfacial coupling governs molecular epitaxy on graphene/SiC, and interface engineering via hydrogen intercalation provides a scalable route to control organic thin-film crystallinity on graphene."}

The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment.

We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime.

Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths > 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 μeV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs.

We find that the relative twist between polygons induces noncollinear chiral phases, ranging from flux vortex closure to hedgehog like radial configurations. Chirality, quantified in terms of a bond order parameter, is an emergent property that behaves here as an Ising variable. The chiral configurations of the systems can be understood in terms of chirality and clock index order parameters, whose evolution with twist occurs through two types of first order phase transitions. Within a fixed Ising chiral sector, the clock index, rooted in the $C_N$ invariance of the polygons, characterizes chiral textures that share chirality. As the twist increases, it continuously shifts the preferred relative clock phase, but the Nfold anisotropy only allows discrete orientations; the competition produces a tilted Nfold energy landscape whose global minimum hops discontinuously between clock sectors. As the number of sites in the polygon grows, the resulting response displays a nonlinear crossover from rigid, Ising like behavior to an almost $\\rm U(1)$ invariant regime, governed by a twist induced suppression of the emergent $Z_N$ clock anisotropy. A Landau phenomenology captures these trends and naturally extends to bilayer lattices, where we show that twisted honeycomb systems realize an effective sine-Gordon theory with twist-controlled transitions between isolated domain walls and domain wall lattices."}

We develop a continuum model for the shrinking dynamics of antiskyrmions in bulk DMI systems, using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the time derivative of the magnetization field. Owing to the structure of their azimuthal angle, or helicity, elliptic antiskyrmions are energetically favored over circular ones. To capture this feature, we parametrize the magnetization field with a triangular radial profile and an elliptic in-plane shape. This ansatz yields four coupled dynamical equations governing time evolution of the semi-axes, helicities, and rotation angles. In the absence of the DMI, circular antiskyrmions shrink isotropically, exhibiting a crossover from exponential decay to square-root collapse. Initially elliptic antiskyrmions are driven towards circularity. For finite DMI, the semi-axes dynamics couples to the helicity and rotation, where the theory predicts a rotation angle following by half of the slope of the helicity evolution which is linear in time. Only at small semi-axes a cross-over to a logarithmic divergence occurs. The shrinking dynamics of the antiskyrmion size is found to be accompanied by quadrupole-like oscillations. Numerical simulations on the lattice support the predictions from the continuum model."}

Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) to quantify how H absorption affects electronic structure, magnetic exchange, and anisotropy in representative Sr2Fe2O5 and Sr2Co2O5 oxides. We find that hydrogenation introduces a localized electron that stabilizes near the proton, with B-site-dependent preference. The resulting lattice distortions and redistribution of charge density modify exchange coupling and cant the Neel vector, giving rise to weak ferromagnetism. We also show that absorption energies are highly sensitive to proton-electron arrangements and magnetic order, varying by up to 1 eV across different settings. This sensitivity demands consistent treatment of charge localization and spin states, together with careful choice of computational parameters. Extending to a variety of experimentally reported A2B2O5 compositions, we identify candidates with favorable H uptake and uncover a trend linking more favorable absorption to a higher B-site d-electron count. We also demonstrate that the preferred proton absorption site in these materials is governed by local O-O separations and lattice flexibility, which describe the ability of the framework to accommodate proton-induced distortions. Finally, benchmarks of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials reveal uncertainties of about 1 eV for site-resolved absorption energies, motivating descriptor-based surrogate models and targeted DFT validation.

While previous analyses neglected edge-to-edge capacitance, we show that capacitive effects, which are known to play a crucial role in mesoscopic capacitors, modify both the current and the current cross-correlations. Using a two-point Green's function formalism augmented by Dyson's equation to include the charging energy, we quantify how the fluctuations of the cross-correlations depend simultaneously on $λ$ and on the capacitance of the loop. Our results indicate that a reliable extraction of the statistical angle requires a parallel measurement of the loop capacitance, which can be implemented via a charged gate coupled to the junction."}

However, a central challenge in the PS process lies in achieving precise control over thermal self-stabilization in the presence of complex microstructural effects arising from photonic-ray--induced thermal profiles. To elucidate the interplay among thermal fields, microstructural evolution, and PS process parameters, this study establishes a two-scale, non-isothermal simulation framework. The framework integrates macroscopic heat-transfer simulations, incorporating effective heat conduction and photonic-ray--induced volumetric heating in the porous media, with microscopic non-isothermal phase-field sintering simulations that resolve microstructure evolution under local thermal profile. Scale bridging is achieved through a temperature field transferring and mapping that satisfies Hill-Mandel condition between the macroscopic and microscopic simulations, while maintaining synchronization between their asynchronous time-stepping schemes. After calibrating model parameters against experimental measurements, the framework successfully reproduces the experimentally observed porosity inhomogeneity along the sample depth. The influence of enhanced localized mass transport is further examined through a parametric investigation of surface and grain boundary diffusivities. Overall, the proposed framework demonstrates its feasibility and physical interpretability in establishing process-microstructure relationships for the scalable fabrication of high-performance protonic ceramics."}

A new avenue was recently opened in this field by predicting that the Josephson quantum mechanics in the odd parity sector, when a quasiparticle in trapped in an Andreev bound state, is fundamentally different from the conventional one in the even sector. The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime. Our prediction could be tested in forthcoming experiments with superconductor/semiconductor/superconductor junctions, which have been studied intensively in recent years, both using nanowires as well as two-dimensional electron gases."}

Here, we bridge the spatiotemporal gap in modeling complex heterostructures by developing an accurate machine-learned force fields based on neuroevolution potential, enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 heterostructures. By systematically investigating four representative low-lattice-mismatch ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 interfaces, we identify spontaneous interfacial amorphization driven by space-charge effects upon surface cleavage, trapping Li+ and leading to under-coordinated Li+ polyhedrons with pronounced geometric distortion. These distorted amorphous interfacial regions exhibit markedly enhanced Li+ hopping activity, significantly outperforming the bulk lattice, provided that local mobile Li+ inventory is not depleted by surface charge redistribution.

Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the THz emission from various magnetic heterostructures. The dynamics of the spin current is described by the semiclassical, superdiffusive spin-transport model and the energy dependence of the spin Hall effect of hot electrons is taken into account, leading to emission profiles for Co(2 nm)/Pt(4 nm) bilayer in good agreement with experiment. To identify the optimal {conditions} for THz emission, {we study} the properties of the emitted THz wave profile by systematically varying the layer thicknesses of metallic bilayers, their interfacial spin-current transmission properties, their materials' dependence, and influence of the pump laser-pulse width, allowing us to give optimization guidelines. We find that thin nonmagnetic layer thicknesses of 5-6 nm provide the largest bandwidth in the case of Co/Pt and that the peak frequency of the THz emission depends only on the geometry of the emitter and not on the laser pulse width. The THz bandwidth {is conversely found to} depend on several factors such as exciting laser pulse width, layers' thicknesses, and interface transmission-reflection properties, with the limitation that an increase in the bandwidth by tuning the interface properties comes with a trade-off in the energy efficiency of the emitter.

Monte Carlo simulations reveal significant spin fluctuations, spin-spin correlations and an absence of conventional magnons in such anomalous state; while the response of the anomalous state to perturbation is found to be akin to an overdamped forced oscillator.

In this work, we analytically calculate the 2D Zak phase for a 2D non-Hermitian SSH-type Hamiltonian that supports a rich structure and edge currents. Closed-form expressions for eigenstates and divisions of the phase diagram are obtained, including for regions in the phase diagram where different types of exceptional points exist.

Therefore, precise control of magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal is essential to balance sensitivity and stability in PHE sensors. In this work, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal mechanisms of Ni-Fe- and Co-Fe-based multilayers grown on various metallic buffer layers and deposited with and without an external magnetic field, in order to evaluate the effects of the buffer layers and field-assisted deposition on the resulting magnetic anisotropy. NiFe films exhibit a dominant uniaxial anisotropy mainly determined by the applied field during growth, with an anisotropy constant of approximately $3,\\mathrm{kerg,cm^{-3}}$, largely independent of the buffer layer. In contrast, the magnetic anisotropy of CoFe films is dominated by the buffer layer, resulting in a biaxial magnetic response.

Recently, multiple experiments have observed half-quantum flux shifts in measurements of LP oscillations, where the oscillations are globally shifted by half a flux quantum compared to conventional cases, a behavior referred to as a $π$-ring. Such observations are commonly linked to unconventional pairing symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $π$-rings."}

The absorption increase is directly related to the ionization of the Si donor and Mg acceptor levels, which are controlled by the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels.

Calculations were used to obtain the equilibrium state of the hydrogen atom deep in the GaN bulk and at the GaN(0001) surface. It was shown that the H position within bulk GaN depends on the Fermi level: in n-type GaN, it is located in the channel, whereas in p-type GaN, it is attached to the N atom, breaking one of the GaN bonds. In contrast, at the GaN(0001) surface, H is attached in the on-top position for any hydrogen coverage; for low and high H-coverage, the Fermi level is pinned at the Ga - broken bond state and at the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively. The diffusion path from the bulk to the surface was obtained when the Fermi level was high and low, the barrier was zero, and $ΔE_{bar} \\approx 1.717 eV$, which effectively blocked hydrogen escape into the vapor. Thus, high H coverage, that is, high hydrogen pressure in the vapor, prevents H from escaping from the bulk to the surface, whereas at low coverage (low hydrogen pressure), the process is barrierless. It is therefore proven that the hydrogen escape control step in the Nakamura process is the transition of hydrogen from the bulk to the surface, which is controlled by the position of the Fermi level at the surface. Molecular hydrogen desorption from the surface is easy for high H coverage and difficult for low, thus opposite to observed experimentally thus this process is not the determining step in activation. A full thermodynamic estimate of the maximal partial pressure of hydrogen in the vapor, corresponding to the transition of the Fermi level from the Ga-broken bond state to the VBM, was used to establish the maximal hydrogen pressure limit for the p-type Mg activation process."}

Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT.

Here, we employ cryogenic atom probe tomography to directly analyse frozen liquid solid reaction interfaces at near atomic resolution. Focusing on the interaction of iodide and sodium ions with nanoporous gold, we observe the formation of iodine containing complexes on gold nanoligament surfaces and subsurfaces. These findings reveal aspects of the gold iodide system that were previously hidden, including the reaction mechanism between iodide and gold atoms on the surface, and the multiple gold iodide complexes forming. Our work demonstrates that cryogenic atom probe tomography can provide unprecedented visualisation and characterisation of nanoscale interfaces during chemical and electrochemical reactions, with potential implications for modern manufacturing, energy technologies, and sustainable materials development."}

To be submitted for peer review", "summary": "La-Fe-Si-based alloys are among the most application-ready magnetocaloric materials for room-temperature magnetic refrigeration. Powder metallurgy methods have been previously demonstrated to successfully produce structures with sub-mm features for magnetic refrigerators in a scalable method. In this work, we explore the rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) present in a 0.27 mm thin plate of sintered and hydrogenated La(Fe,Mn,Si)$_{13}$. The high aspect ratio ($\\sim$50) of the thin plate leads to an anisotropic magnetocaloric effect (MCE), dependent on the relative orientation of the external magnetic field, and an RMCE when the external field is rotated. We find a maximum rotating adiabatic temperature change ($ΔT_{ad}^{rot}$) of 1.17 K with the rotation of a 1 T magnetic field and 1.12 K when rotating a 0.6 T magnetic field, a reduction of only 4% for a 40% reduction in applied field strength. Magnetostatic computations revealed a considerable rotating isothermal entropy change ($ΔS_{iso}^{rot}$), comparable to the conventional MCE of Gd for similar fields, reaching 3.97 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for 1 T and 3.68 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for 0.6 T (7% reduction), highlighting La-Fe-Mn-Si alloys as high potential candidates for a magnetic refrigerator based on the RMCE utilizing relatively low external magnetic field amplitudes, such as 0.6 T."}

However, the underlying pairing mechanism and its relationship to the material's electronic and magnetic ground states remain elusive. Since unconventional superconductivity often emerges from a complex interplay of magnetic correlations, elucidating the magnetic ground state of the nickelates at ambient pressure is crucial for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure. Here, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with tight-binding model simulation to investigate the electronic structure of the representative trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We provide the first experimental evidence of band splitting induced by interlayer coupling and further resolve the momentum-dependent density wave gap structures along all the Fermi surfaces. Our findings identify the mirror-selective Fermi surface nesting as the origin of the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin density wave and demonstrate the dominant role of Ni-3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in the low-energy physics of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. These results provide a fundamental framework for understanding the magnetic interactions and high-temperature superconductivity mechanism in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family."}

However, SPE creation in 2D semiconductors on rigid substrates like SiO2/Si via nanoindentation is a technological gap, critical for interfacing SPEs with photonic circuits and cavities. Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths > 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 μeV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs. Our work is directly applicable to other 2D materials and photonic circuit/cavity compatible rigid substrates and is a significant step for scalable SPE technologies."}

Here we report the synthesis, characterization and magnetotransport measurements of the Pb/Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$ (BSCCO) superconducting heterostructures, where an insulating PbO$_{x}$ layer spontaneously forms at the interface. Non-volatile switching between superconducting (logical \"0\") and normal (\"1\") states in Pb films by an external field, i.e., infinite magnetoresistance (IMR), can be realized and are attributed to the strong trapping and pinning of vortices in BSCCO. Furthermore, butterfly-shaped hysteresis loops in magnetoresistance, pronounced resistance dips/jumps and thermal reset to superconducting states can be observed and are direct manifestations of the peculiar vortex dynamics in BSCCO and vortex coupling across the Pb/BSCCO interface. Our work demonstrates a simple and effective way to realize IMR through superconducting vortices and opens up new opportunities to study the vortex interactions across the superconducting interfaces."}

Recently, multiple experiments have observed half-quantum flux shifts in measurements of LP oscillations, where the oscillations are globally shifted by half a flux quantum compared to conventional cases, a behavior referred to as a $π$-ring. Such observations are commonly linked to unconventional pairing symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $π$-rings."}
