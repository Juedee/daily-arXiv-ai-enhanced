We consider a superconducting strip with a narrow pinch point at which vortices cross quasi-periodically below a spin qubit as a result of a bias current. We demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the spin qubit exhibits a pronounced peak if the vortex-crossing frequency matches the transition frequency of the spin qubit and conclude that the magnetic flux $Φ$ of a single vortex can be obtained by dividing the corresponding voltage along the strip with the transition frequency. We discuss experimental constraints on implementing our proposed setup in spin-triplet candidate materials like UTe$_2$, UPt$_3$, and URhGe."}

Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $Φ_{\\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(θ,\\varphi)$: $θ$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs."}

The phenomenon called Ising protection is caused by two magnetically active potentials: a Zeeman field and an Ising spin-orbit interaction. These potentials induce two spin-triplet pairing correlations in a spin-singlet superconductor. One belonging to odd-frequency symmetry class arises solely from a Zeeman field and always makes the superconducting state unstable. The other belonging to even-frequency symmetry class arise from the interaction between the two magnetic potentials and eliminate the instability caused by odd-frequency pairs. The presence or absence of even-frequency spin-triplet pairs explains the anisotropy of the Ising protection.

A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \\pm 1.5 °$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet \"surfs\", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications."}

We observe a giant anomalous $\\varphi_0$-shift of the current-phase relation, which we attribute to the fact that HgTe surface states feature a single Fermi contour. Moreover, by varying the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field, we obtain information about the spin texture in momentum space.

In homogeneous type-II superconductors, each vortex has a tiny core where the superconducting gap $Δ(r)$ is known to smoothly vanish towards the core centre on the scale of the coherence length $ξ$. The cores host quantized quasiparticle energy levels known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) bound states [Caroli {\\it et al.,} Phys. Lett. v. 9, 307 (1964)]. In pure materials, the spectrum of the low-lying CdGM states has the characteristic level spacing $\\sim Δ_0^2/E_F$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy and $Δ_0$ is the bulk gap. In disordered ones, the CdGM states shift and broaden due to scattering. Here, we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that the situation is completely different in granular Nb films, which are commonly used in superconducting electronics. In these films, in which the grains are smaller than $ξ$, the gap $Δ$ in the quasiparticle spectrum reduces towards the vortex core centres by discrete jumps at the grain boundaries. The bound states adapt to the local environment and appear at unexpectedly high energies. Both $Δ(r)$ and bound states form a puzzle-like spatial structure of the core, elements of which are whole grains.

The potential advantages of KANs over MLP-NNs, including significantly enhanced parameter efficiency and increased interpretability, make them a promising new regression model in supervised machine learning problems. We apply KANs to prediction of materials properties, focusing on a diverse set of 33 properties consisting of both experimental and calculated data. We compare the KAN results to random forest, a method that generally gives excellent performance on a wide range of properties predictions with very little optimization. The KANs were worse, on par, or better than random forest about 35%, 60%, and 5% of the time, respectively, and KANs are in practice more difficult to fit than random forest. By tuning the network architecture, we found property fits often resulted in 10-20% lower errors compared to the standard KAN, and typically gave results comparable to random forest. In the specific context of predicting reactor pressure vessel transition temperature shifts, we explored the parameter efficiency and the interpretable power of KANs by comparing predictions of simple KAN models (e.g., < 50 parameters) and closed-form expressions suggested by the KAN fits to previously published deep MLP-NNs and hand-tuned models created using domain expertise of embrittlement physics. We found that simple KAN models and the resulting closed-form expressions produce prediction errors on par with established hand-tuned models with a comparable number of parameters, and required essentially no domain expertise to produce. These findings reinforce the potential applicability of KANs for machine learning in materials science and suggest that KANs should be explored as a regression model for prediction of materials properties."}

In this topical review, we discuss recent developments of coupled-wire description in nanoscale systems, where it emerges not only as a theoretical tool but also as a highly tunable physical platform. In these nanoscale realizations, coupled-wire networks are formed by one-dimensional channels embedded in two-dimensional materials, most prominently in moiré and twisted structures. Such networks host a broad range of unconventional states of matter, including superconductivity, charge density waves, spin density waves, Mott insulating phases, Anderson insulating phases, quantum spin Hall states, quantum anomalous Hall states, and their fractionalized counterparts. The ability to electrically control interaction strength, confinement, and coupling between wires makes these systems qualitatively different from earlier realizations and allows continuous tuning between competing phases. Notably, recent work has demonstrated that the coupled-wire framework in moiré networks completes the trio of quantum Hall phenomena, encompassing quantum Hall, quantum spin Hall, and quantum anomalous Hall states, together with their fractional analogues. This development highlights coupled-wire networks in nanoscale materials as a versatile and experimentally relevant setting for exploring the interplay of topology, strong correlations, and low-dimensional physics."}

Recently, nitridized Aluminum (NitrAl) has been found to display higher critical temperatures and enhanced resilience to magnetic fields compared to those of Al, making it a new interesting candidate for superconducting quantum circuit applications. However, the microscopic properties of NitrAl remain highly unexplored. Here we use Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) to measure the superconducting density of states of a thin film sample of nitridized-Aluminum (NitrAl), with a room temperature resistivity between pure Al and fully insulating aluminum nitride. We show that the in-gap density of states is zero up to about $\\hbarω=250~\\mathrm{μeV}$ and that there is a distribution of values of the superconducting gap around $Δ_0=360~\\mathrm{μeV}$, close to the BCS expectation $Δ=1.76 k_{\\mathrm{B}}T_{\\mathrm{c}}$.

This study demonstrates the realization of atomically coherent, chemically bonded interface in twisted NaNbO3 heterostructures through controlled oxygen-annealing treatment. Atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy reveal ordered perovskite registry accompanied by systematic lattice contraction and modified electronic structure at the twisted interface, providing signatures of chemical reconstruction rather than physical adhesion. This reconstructed interface mediates highly asymmetric strain propagation in which the bottom membrane remains nearly relaxed while the top membrane accommodates substantial shear strain, thereby establishing a strain gradient that enables long-range electromechanical coupling throughout the twisted oxide membranes.

Here, we combine specific heat capacity (C_V) and magnetic circular dichroism measurements to identify these critical points, extract a tricritical exponent, and map out the complete magnetic phase diagram of 2D Ising metamagnetic CrI3. This is achieved in a nanomechanical device of 6-layer CrI3, in which a direct measurement of the temperature derivative of its mechanical resonance frequency gives C_V.

Achieving this integration demands that memory materials exhibit high thermal resilience, with the capability to operate reliably at elevated temperatures such as 125C, due to the substantial heat generated by front-end transistors. However, silicon-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectrics tend to exhibit antiferroelectric-like behavior in this temperature range, accompanied by a more pronounced wake-up effect, posing significant challenges to their thermal reliability. Here, we report that by introducing a thin tungsten oxide (WO3-x) layer-known as an oxygen reservoir-and carefully tuning its oxygen content, ultra-thin Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (5 nm) films can be made robust against the ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric transition at elevated temperatures. This approach not only minimizes polarization loss in the pristine state but also effectively suppresses the wake-up effect, reducing the required wake-up cycles from 105 to only 10 at 125C- a qualifying temperature for back-end memory integrated with front-end logic, as defined by the JEDEC standard.

Using a frequency-shift dynamic matrix and an interaction-resolved dynamic energy-density formalism, we show that the frequency asymmetry cannot generally be ascribed to dipolar effects alone. Instead, once counterpropagating modes differ in their geometric structure along the thickness, interlayer exchange dominates the frequency shift. Applied to representative multilayer systems, we find that the interlayer exchange contribution exceeds dipolar and intralayer exchange effects by up to two to three orders of magnitude over a broad wave-vector range. Our results establish interlayer exchange as the primary mechanism controlling nonreciprocal dispersion in multilayer magnonic systems and provide a quantitative framework for engineering large frequency shifts in nonreciprocal magnonic devices."}

Using real time Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations with thermal fluctuations, and a macrospin model that includes both the intrinsic cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a shape-induced uniaxial contribution, we analyze shape-polydisperse systems under clinically and technologically relevant field conditions. We show that for relatively large particles, around 25 to 30 nm, the relative dispersion of local (single-particle) losses exhibits a well-defined minimum at moderate field amplitudes (between 4 to 12 mT), hence identifying an optimal operating regime that minimizes heating heterogeneity while maintaining substantial power dissipation. The position of this critical field depends mainly on particle size and excitation frequency, and only weakly on shape dispersion, offering practical guidelines for improving heating uniformity in realistic MFH systems."}

Recent studies have shown that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lift these restrictions and enable highly nonlinear spin and charge currents. Here we propose a distinct mechanism for high-harmonic spin pumping that does not rely on spin-orbit interactions. We show that nonlinearities in the adiabatic energy spectrum--rather than SOC itself--constitute the essential ingredient for high-harmonic generation in pumped spin currents. Such nonlinearities can arise in purely magnetic systems when a secondary magnetic order parameter is introduced perpendicular to the cone axis of a precessing magnetic moment. As a result, spin pumping and its higher harmonics emerge even in the complete absence of SOC. Our findings establish a new route to ultrafast spin pumping based solely on magnetic structure and dynamics."}

Achieving such coherent, epitaxial interfaces is a key step toward enabling spintronic phenomena in 1D objects, by minimizing interface scattering and strain-driven defects. Our results demonstrate a successful realization of controlled nanoscale heteroepitaxy in one-dimensional single-crystal structures.

Building on liquid metal diamond synthesis, this approach pushes liquid metal growth toward a low temperature (900 °C, 1 atm) while enabling single crystal diamonds to be scaled from ~10 μm to several tens of micrometers with well developed faceting. Ferrocene decomposition supplies a sustained interfacial carbon flux that is captured and redistributed by the Ga In melt toward seed rich liquid solid interfaces. Defect rich nanodiamond provides the crystallographic template required for reliable sp3 nucleation despite the intrinsically low carbon solubility of Ga In. Nanosilicon plays a distinct, complementary role by tuning interfacial kinetics and facet competition, enabling deliberate control of crystal habit: cubic (~10 μm), truncated tetrahedral, and fully faceted octahedral diamonds are reproducibly obtained by adjusting the nanosilicon:nanodiamond ratio, with octahedral crystals reaching ~50 μm. Importantly, crystal size is further scaled by regulating hydrogen flow: lowering the H2 rate increases net carbon retention at the liquid metal interface, raises effective supersaturation, and accelerates diamond deposition. Together, habit control (via nanosilicon: nanodiamond) and size scaling (via H2 flow) establish a practical route silicon driven facet regulation and size under ambient pressure, offering a pathway to tunable micro sized single crystal diamonds under mild conditions."}

Here, using atomistic superconducting transport simulations, we show that the additivity of excess decay rate enables clear separation of Andreev and quasiparticle currents. In particular, we reveal how their competition as well as higher-order scattering processes shape both the decay rate spectra and their dependence on the coupling strength. We show that this phenomenology stems from the fact that Andreev reflection dominates mid-gap conductance for s-wave superconductors, it is suppressed for the d-wave, and it coexists with quasiparticle tunneling in sign-changing symmetries if the expectation value for the superconducting gap remains finite. These distinct spectral fingerprints pave the way for atomically resolved identification of unconventional superconducting states."}

X-ray diffraction reveals a thermal stability limit of 1150 °C independent of the O concentration, as witnessed by the formation of decomposition products, namely h-Cr$_{2}$N for (Cr$_{0.50}$Al$_{0.50}$)$_{0.49}$N$_{0.51}$ and c-Cr for both (Cr$_{0.48}$Al$_{0.52}$)$_{0.48}$(O$_{0.15}$N$_{0.85}$)$_{0.52}$ and (Cr$_{0.44}$Al$_{0.56}$)$_{0.46}$(O$_{0.40}$N$_{0.60}$)$_{0.54}$. Based on TEM and ERDA data, the thermal stability limit is extended to 1100 - 1150 °C. DFT calculations indicate that bond breaking limits the thermal stability. In (Cr,Al)N, N has the lowest activation energy for migration. Furthermore, the O vacancy formation energy is highest in (Cr,Al)(O,N). It has to be overcome to enable diffusion on the non-metal sublattice, which is necessary for forming decomposition products like w-AlN or c-Cr. However, once Cr-N bonds break, decomposition into h-Cr$_{2}$N and subsequent c-Cr together with N$_{2}$ is triggered. This results in N evaporation, generating sufficient non-metal vacancies that greatly enhance diffusion and render the extensive vacancy formation energies for non-metals irrelevant. This reduction of the activation energy for mass transport on the non-metal sublattice to the migration barrier causes the similar thermal stability in (Cr$_{0.47 \\mp 0.03}$Al$_{0.53 \\mp 0.03}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$. In contrast, Al bonds break first without creating non-metal vacancies in (Ti,Al)(O,N).

Extending the classical limiting current concept, we demonstrate that a thick, poorly conductive SEI and sluggish desolvation significantly reduce the limiting current.

However, in rare cases, an interplay between magnetic fields and ions can be engineered to bring about superconductivity at finite fields. Here we use ultra-thin LaSb$_2$ doped with dilute Ce paramagnetic impurities to demonstrate a magnetic field-induced superconducting dome in a two-dimensional crystal. The reduced dimensionality of the structure enables the use of an in-plane magnetic field to dynamically suppress spin fluctuations on the Ce-site, which leads to an anomalous enhancement of the critical temperature with increasing field. By modelling the spin scattering dynamics across the experimental parameter space, we reveal insight into the complex nature of paramagnetic impurities in magnetic fields at low temperature, and how their manipulation can result in the ability to tune between competing magnetic pair-breaking regimes. Realizing this physics in a two-dimensional crystalline setting invites the application of similar approaches to unconventional forms of superconductivity while also highlighting new experimental standards which should be employed when studying ultra-thin materials in general."}
