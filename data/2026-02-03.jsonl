Despite being the precursor of superconducting hydrides, a detailed picture of its phase diagram in an extended temperature and pressure range is still missing. To determine it with inclusion of both thermal and quantum effects, we carry out path integral molecular dynamics combined to a MACE neural network potential trained on BLYP density functional theory configurations. The resulting H$_3$S phase diagram is characterized by the ferroelectric transition between the Im$\\bar{3}$m and R3m phases, which originates from a quantum critical point (QCP) located at $p_\\mathrm{QCP} \\approx 134$ GPa. We show that the experimental $T_c$ peak falls into a paraelectric region of large nuclear quantum fluctuations above the ferroelectric QCP, as measured by local phonon Green's functions resolved in imaginary time, where fluctuating dipole moments are at play. We study the critical behavior of the system in the proximity of the QCP by a finite-size scaling analysis, showing that it belongs to the 4D Ising universality class. We finally discuss its implications for the superconducting state."}

Theoretically, we investigate the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional spin-polarized attractive Hubbard model on a square optical lattice under an effective Zeeman field by computing the density and spin dynamical structure factors, focusing on phase transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to an Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid. In the FFLO superfluid, besides the phonon mode in the density channel, a low-energy bogolon mode emerges in the spin channel, which is associated with Bogoliubov quasiparticles on a Bogoliubov Fermi surface. Moreover, the dynamical excitations exhibit pronounced anisotropy in momentum space due to the finite COM momentum. At half filling, the roton mode around $[π,π]$ evolves from a point-like minimum into a ring structure shifted by the COM momentum across the BCS-FFLO transition, providing a roton-based protocol to extract the COM momentum. These predictions provide key insights for confirming the existence of FFLO superfluids and understanding their dynamical excitation spectra."}

We observe a SDW-induced redistribution of spectral weight on both the $α$ pocket at the Brillouin-zone centre and a portion of the $β$ pocket near the zone boundary, characterized by gap energies of approximately 55~meV.

Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $Δ_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \\le Δ$, so that bulk $Δ(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized.

For class A in two spatial dimensions, we find a general inequality linking the Floquet quantum metric tensor and the Floquet topology: the associated quantum volume is bounded below by the Floquet topological invariant. This relation is found to also hold in class AIII in one dimension, where the Floquet geometric tensor may be notably reduced due to time-reflection symmetry. This work will be useful in digesting the general aspects of quantum geometry in periodically driven systems in connection with their topological characterization."}

To obtain the exchange ($b_x$) and correlation ($b_{c}$) contributions to the coefficient $b_{xc}$, i.e., to the prefactor of the $q^2$ term of the proper-polarization function, we revisited all the previous calculations and expose misconceptions which led to incorrect conclusions. We used various ways to apply a necessary regularization to the singular Coulomb interaction potential. We found that the separate exchange ($b_x$) and correlation ($b_c$) contributions to the coefficient $b_{xc}$ have regularization-scheme dependent values even though the regulator is set to zero at the end of the calculation. This implies that it is impossible to define such a separation meaningfully. On the contrary, we found that when the regulator is set to zero at the end of the calculation, the combination $b_{xc}$ is regularization-scheme independent and, thus, has a unique value. We conclude that it is incorrect to separate those two terms when constructing a generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA) contribution to the density functional. This appears to be a common approach in most popular GGA functionals, where various constraints are applied to each contribution separately."}

By training an interpretable max-affine model directly on near-hull formation energies from the Materials Project density-functional theory (DFT) database, we find that the hull can be reconstructed to DFT accuracy using a polyhedron with only seven facets. These facets define seven chemically coherent materials classes, with just seven coefficients per element sufficing to capture the dominant energetic trends across composition space. Remarkably, this compact, composition-only representation generalizes far beyond bulk formation energies. Without retraining or structural input, the same model reproduces trends in DFT-calculated defect formation energies, captures experimentally observed elemental mixing correlations in high-entropy materials, and enables the construction and optimization of Pourbaix diagrams for electrochemical stability. Together, these results show that many materials properties governed by energy differences can be expressed as simple linear combinations of a small set of interpretable, element-specific parameters. The result is a bonding-geometry-free thermodynamic framework that unifies stability, defects, mixing, and electrochemistry, and enables rapid, interpretable screening across vast chemical spaces."}

In this work, we bring these steps together in a unified Python-based framework built around three interoperable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for nanochannel, nanopore and memristor experiments. The framework is organised into two functional parts, measurement and analysis. On the measurement side, two GUIs drive Keithley Source Meters to run continuous voltage sweeps and user-defined memristive pulse sequences, while providing live plots, configuration management and controlled shutdown routines. On the analysis side, a dedicated nanochannel and nanopore GUI reads raw I-V datasets, applies unit-consistent processing, extracts conductance and ion mobility, evaluates selectivity and osmotic power, and is complemented by a web-based calculator that performs the same mobility analysis without a local Python installation.

The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in disordered systems such as the diffusion length and the localization length. However, in disordered systems with vanishing or nearly vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain what determines the important length scales in such systems. In this work, we use the 1D Lieb lattice with isolated flat bands as an example to show that the quantum metric length (QML) is a fundamental length scale in the ballistic, diffusive and localization regimes. The QML is defined through the Bloch state wave functions of the flat bands. In the ballistic regime with short junctions, the QML controls the finite energy transport properties. In the localization regime with long junctions, the localization length is determined by the QML and remarkably, independent of disorder strength over a wide range of disorder strength. We call this unconventional localization regime, the quantum metric localization regime. In the diffusive regime, we demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient is linearly proportional to the QML via the wave-packet dynamics numerically. Importantly, the numerical results are consistent with the analytical results obtained through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We conclude that the QML is a fundamentally important length scale governing the properties of disordered flat band materials."}

Here, we combine in situ gas-cell and multimodal electron microscopy to disentangle the temperature-, pressure-, and chemistry-dependent restructuring of AuRu catalysts, revealing pathways accessible only at atmospheric pressure. As synthesized, AuRu nanocatalysts are polycrystalline face-centered-cubic alloys with Au/Ru intermixing that phase-segregate into Au- and Ru-rich domains with elevated temperature (>450 °C). Increased pressure (~1 atm in 3:1, hydrogen:nitrogen) unlocks pronounced faceting and internal nanovoid formation, which systematic gas-chemistry variation identifies as hydrogen-driven. Density functional theory-based interatomic potentials show that hydrogen can amplify Au/Ru diffusion asymmetry, promoting nanovoid formation via a gas-mediated Kirkendall mechanism. Together, these results bridge the pressure gap between traditional in situ electron microscopy and benchtop ammonia reactors, enabling resolution of distinct restructuring stimuli in multicomponent systems."}

Such bowing effects are essential for band gap engineering in semiconductor alloys. Upward band gap bowing effects are rather rare, hindering the exploration on half of the available physical property space of alloys. Part of the this being a rare event is related to the need to stabilize an alloy with low mixing enthalpy, so it does not phase separate. In this paper we find via density functional theory that one can satisfy the simultaneous conditions of negative mixing enthalpy and upward band gap bowing in four-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys in the cubic perovskite structure. Such perovskite alloys have the B-site occupied by a mixture of group IVB and IIB elements that have the IVB-s and IIB-s states in the valence bands and conduction bands, respectively, leaving the delocalized s states strongly repel each other. This s-s repulsion leads to the upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpies simultaneously. Remarkably, we identify a perovskite alloy that has a band gap much larger than all its components. Analogous trends of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy also appear in the corresponding three-component and two-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys. These observations of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy will significantly accelerate the design of stable upward band gap bowing alloys in a broad range of material families."}

However, realizations have mostly been limited to classical applications or artificial setups. In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems."}

The HSE06 band gap is incorporated using the scissor correction method along with PBE calculated electronic band structures including spin orbit coupling to accurately predict transport properties. The band gap values are 3.27, 2.50, and 1.55 eV for Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively. The coexistence of heavy and light bands in the Cs2TeI6 band structure helps mitigate the trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Among these systems, Cs2TeI6 exhibits superior performance with a ZT of 1.97 at 800 K and an electronic concentration of 3.35 x 10^19 cm^-3. Such a high ZT at relatively low carrier concentration arises from high electrical conductivity combined with low lattice thermal conductivity. The lattice thermal conductivity of Cs2TeI6 is found to be 0.41 W m^-1 K^-1 at room temperature. This low lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to weak Te-I bonding and non-uniform out-of-phase displacement of Cs atoms. The presence of local TeX6 units together with weak bonds strongly resists heat conduction, leading to significant suppression of lattice thermal conductivity. In particular, transverse acoustic phonons and optical phonons play a key role in limiting lattice thermal conductivity. These results identify Cs2TeI6 as a promising candidate for high performance thermoelectric applications."}

Here, based on group theory analysis, we present a scheme for rapidly identifying the Weyl-Dirac nodal lines (a complex of Weyl and Dirac nodal lines) in bosonic systems. We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features.

Here we propose an interpretable \"multimodal\" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials."}

In the regime where the dot size is comparable to the Fermi wavelength, we identify a clear crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization as the Rashba coupling increases. This transition is accompanied by gate-tunable spin currents of Edelstein and spin Hall type, whose behavior reflects the underlying electron wavefunction interference. Notably, the Edelstein current shows an inflection point at the critical Rashba strength, signaling the crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field we also report a transition in angular periodicity of the magnetoresistance -- from $π$ to $2π$ -- arising from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman coupling. These results establish a direct link between quantum coherence, charge-to-spin conversion, and geometric confinement in mesoscopic systems."}

Particular emphasis is placed on recent ways of representing spectral band structures (SBS) of the direct and inverse dielectric functions, such as analytical approaches based on multipole-Padé approximants in momentum and frequency (MPA($\\q$)), which provide a combined band-like description of the dispersion of the main collective excitations.

The pairing imbalance significantly enlarges the parameter region supporting a topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, we show that a topologically nontrivial phase hosting Majorana zero modes can be induced by varying the pairing imbalance, even in the regime of strong chemical potential. The gap-closing points and phase boundaries are determined analytically, and the resulting phase diagrams are characterized by a nonzero topological invariant.

However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally.

Using these correlated states, we compute the exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements. The resulting phonon spectral densities for different excitonic complexes are compared with the widely used analytical super-Ohmic form and reveal deviations at higher energies originating from the realistic dot geometry and atomistic wave functions, whereas configuration mixing is found to play only a minor role. Furthermore, we extract radiative lifetimes comparable to values experimentally measured. As a direct application, we simulate the emission brightness of a pulsed-driven quantum dot and demonstrate that the atomistically derived spectral density substantially broadens the region of efficient off-resonant excitation compared to the analytical model. The presented framework provides a nearly parameter-free route to simulate the non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in semiconductor quantum dots."}

As an illustrative case, we have carried out an in-depth experimental as well as theoretical investigation of structural, magnetic, and transport properties of a polycrystalline anti-Heusler alloy, Al$_2$MnFe. While the major atomic disorder is found to be among Fe and Mn atoms, which are randomly distributed among the two octahedral sites, 4$a$ and 4$b$ (B2-type disorder), a relatively small fraction ($\\sim$12\\%) of Mn atoms also replace Al atoms at the tetrahedral 8$c$ site. Magnetically, the system undergoes two transitions: a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic transition at $T_{\\rm C}\\sim$113~K, followed by a spin-glass phase transition below $T_{\\rm f}\\sim$20~K.

Here we study theoretically the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the two-dimensional electron liquid near a quantum point contact (QPC) or a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized phases induced by electrostatic gating in the fractional QHE at a filling factor 2/3 and analyze the dependence of the spin transition on temperature and the magnitude of the flowing current. We demonstrate that nearly all nuclear spins in the QPC or in the domain wall can be polarized by the electric current. The Overhauser effective magnetic field from the DNP can be strong enough to induce (or modify) a phase transition between polarized and unpolarized phases. This changes the gate voltages and magnetic fields required for the spin transitions, and leads to the reconstruction of the boundary between two phases and a domain wall and a current path displacement. The spread of nuclear spin polarization and the domain wall displacement are strongly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the current flow. Equilibration due to hyperfine interactions and its role on the nuclear spin polarization, domain wall displacements and spin transitions is studied.

FAIR data principles and workflow-based approaches offer a path to address these limitations. We present reusable atomistic workflows that incorporate metadata annotation aligned with application ontologies, enabling automatic provenance capture and FAIR-compliant data outputs. The workflows cover key mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, including equation of state, elastic tensors, mechanical loading, thermal properties, defect formation energies, and nanoindentation. We demonstrate validation of structure-property relations such as the Hall-Petch effect and show that the workflows can be reused across different interatomic potentials and materials within a coherent semantic framework.

Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators."}

One of the difficulties is that ferromagnetism alone cannot break inversion symmetry $\\mathcal{I}$. Therefore, such a phase cannon be obtained by purely magnetic means. Here, we show how it can be designed by making orbital degrees of freedom active. The idea can be traced back to a basic principle of interatomic exchange, which states that an alternation of occupied orbitals along a bond (i.e., antiferro orbital order) favors ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the antiferro orbital order breaks $\\mathcal{I}$, so that the bond becomes not simply ferromagnetic but also ferroelectric. Then, we formulate main principles governing the realization of such a state in solids, namely: (i) The magnetic atoms should not be located in inversion centers, as in the honeycomb lattice; (ii) The orbitals should be flexible enough to adjust they shape and minimize the energy of exchange interactions; (iii) This flexibility can be achieved by intraatomic interactions, which are responsible for Hund's second rule and compete with the crystal field splitting; (iv) For octahedrally coordinated transition-metal compounds, the most promising candidates appear to be iodides with a $d^{2}$ configuration and relatively weak $d$-$p$ hybridization. Such a situation is realized in the van der Walls compound VI$_3$, which we expect to be ferromagnetic ferroelectric."}

We show that this enhanced DMI facilitates the nucleation and stability of skyrmions using both current-driven and laser-induced skyrmion nucleation. In the devices with an enhanced effective DMI, the density of nucleated skyrmions is greater by up to a factor 20 and skyrmions can be observed in stronger magnetic fields - suggesting that their stability is also improved.

To efficiently screen promising uranium compounds with high thermal conductivity, past studies have leveraged machine-learning models to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, we experimentally examine the model's predictions by fabricating UCo and measuring its high-temperature thermophysical properties.

However, achieving ordered MOFs on TI surfaces remains challenging due to the limited knowledge of self-assembly on these substrates. In this paper, we demonstrate self-assembly of Fe atoms and dicyanoanthracene (DCA) molecules into 2D MOFs on the Bi2Se3(0001) surface at room temperature, investigated via a combination of low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction (LEEM/LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Two competing Fe-DCA phases form. The first phase corresponds to a close-packed Fe1DCA3 structure. In contrast, the second phase exhibits a larger unit cell with no match to either known or DFT-calculated systems, indicating a more complex bonding environment.

Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures."}

This confers great advantages, such as ease in implementation and compatibility in device integration. Here, we shed light on the optical properties of many-particle complexes emerging at the GaInP/MoSe2 interface as a highly relevant material combination to manipulate the optical properties of TMDCs in integrated photonic devices. Our study verifies its nature as a type II hetero-interface, which bears the feasibility to display disorder-free photoluminescence.

This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency."}

By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization.

In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even \"ratcheting\" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity."}

In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials."}

Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems."}

Here, based on group theory analysis, we present a scheme for rapidly identifying the Weyl-Dirac nodal lines (a complex of Weyl and Dirac nodal lines) in bosonic systems. We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features. Our work provides an insight for exploring and leveraging topological properties in systems with coexisting multiple topological states."}

Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect. Our estimates show that the rate of electric-dipole spin-flip transitions exceeds by far that of the magnetic-dipole transitions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers."}

Here, we employ micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($μ$-ARPES) on single-domain Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ to disentangle the complex hierarchy of intrinsic and back-folded bands, explicitly identifying the electronic states driving the DW phase transition. We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $α$ and $β$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\\sim44$ meV on the $α$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $β$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram."}
